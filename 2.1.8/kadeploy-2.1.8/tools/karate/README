karate
======

Karate aims to test kadeploy in order to get failure rate, deployments
duration and  nodes which  fail often.  It  allows to run  tests which
includes ``n'' concurrent deployments (by default 8).

It contains the following scripts in ``bin/'':

- ``karate'': main scripts.

- ``karate-wrapper'':  set RUBYLIB  environment  variable (mainly  for
  cmdctrl) and then run karate.

- ``karate-ssh-wrapper'':  let you  run  ``karate'' on  a machine  and
  kadeploy on  another one, useful  when the reference  environment is
  not up-to-date on the frontend.

You  can obtain  some helps  about these  scripts by  using ``--help''
parameter. You must modify the value of SRC by editing *wrapper scripts
in bin/.
