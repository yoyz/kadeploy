deploy.conf \- Configuration files for kadeploy
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
This file presents all the variables the user must defined in order to be able to use the deployment system\&. It is divided into several sections\&. A very short description is available for each variable and sometimes example values are given in commentary\&.

.PP
The user can find an example in the tools/cookbook folder\&.

.PP
 \fBdeploy_user\fR The UNIX user used with kadeploy\&. All the process launch by kadeploy will swith to this user\&.

.PP
 \fBkadeploy2_directory\fR The base directory of kadeploy equal to \fI\-\-prefix=/basepath/\fR 

.PP
 \fBssh_default_args\fR You can set argument to the ssh command with this\&.

.PP
 \fBprivileged_user\fR you set a priviledged user whith this (like "oar" or "toor")

.PP
 \fBfirst_serial_speed\fR fix the first serial port speed (9600 38400\&.\&.\&.)

.PP
 \fBsecond_serial_speed\fR fix the second serial port speed (9600 38400\&.\&.\&.)

.PP
 \fIMysql database set up\fR 

.PP
 \fBdeploy_db_host\fR value is the hostname where the mysql server that owns the deployment system database is running\&.

.PP
 \fBdeploy_db_name\fR value is the name of the deploy database\&.

.PP
 \fBdeploy_db_login\fR value is the login to access to the deploy database\&.

.PP
 \fBdeploy_db_psswd\fR value is the password to access to the deploy database\&.

.PP
 \fIPreinstall configuration\fR 

.PP
 \fBpre_install_archive\fR value is the absolute path to the preinstall archive containing the pre_install_script\&.

.PP
 \fBpre_install_script\fR value is the name of the script in the preinstall archive that is supposed to be launched during the preinstall step\&.

.PP
 \fBpost_install_script\fR value is the name of the script in the postinstall archive, defined in the database for each environment, that is supposed to be executed during the postinstall step\&.

.PP
 \fBtftp_relative_path\fR value is the directory where the \fIgrub\fR files are generated (for our TFTP_structure, value should be \fIimages_grub/\fR)\&. Some other custom variables are available here to ease the cluster management, by defining kernel/initrd shortcuts for \fIkareboot\fR\&. These custom variables begin with \fIlabel_\fR their values are kernel/initrd pairs that can be assigned to a booting node\&.
