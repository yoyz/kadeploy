.SH NAME
kadeploy-environment \- How to create an environment
.SH "WHAT"

.PP
Kadeploy can currently deploy Linux, *BSD, Solaris, MSDOS, Windows (and all other OS on x86 computer)\&. The forces of kadeploy, is the speed of deployment\&. Deploying one computer is almost has fast as deploying hundred computer\&. An os is pipeline from the first computer to the last to get the best network bandwith\&.

.PP
Currently you can installed it only on any decent linux system and deploy the OS you want\&.

.SH "HOW"

.PP
To deploy an os you must have it installed somewhere\&.\&.\&. kadeploy doesn't offer a clean solution for the first deployment\&.

.PP
LINUX

.PP
Linux has a very good support\&. You have to tar the filesystem in a tarball, with a command like :

.PP
 \fBssh node tar \-\-numeric\-owner \-\-one\-file\-system \-zcSf \- / > archive\&.tgz \fR 

.PP
WINDOWS

.PP
Windows is supported too\&. Windows need a primary partition (1\-4)\&. You have to install it on a FAT32 system, then "tar it" like a linux\&.

.PP
OTHER OS

.PP
A great number of OS need to be installed on a primary partition (not logical one)\&. When you have install it, you have to dump the partition on a file\&. Then karecordenv (1) it\&.

.PP
Example, If you have installed a *BSD on the first partition of your first hardrive, you have to reboot your node to another OS (the deployment system for example with kareset) then launch a command like :

.PP
 \fB ssh node "cat /dev/hda1 |gzip \-9 " > /pathto/XBSD\&.dd\&.gz\fR 

.PP
You can use bzip2 too
